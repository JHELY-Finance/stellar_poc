OK 2. Integrate ARB code with TS/Prisma.
OK 3. Add arb opportunities to the DB
OK 4. Replit that never sleeps as deployment option?
OK 5. Add fee for 3x tx to the arb opportunity calculations
5b. Fee has to be calculated in the same currency as in which we would have arb opportunity
6. Add volume estimator from example java code in /OLD/java_examples 
7. Analyse data from the DB, try to assess if these are reliable arb signals
OK 8. Explore if going counter clockwise would generate different profitability.
  "//1. XLM->USDC->BTC->XLM
  //2. USDC->BTC->XLM->USDC
  //3. BTC->XLM->USDC->BTC
  1,2,3 -- are having the same profitability, 4 can potentially have different
  //4. XLM->BTC->USDC->XLM"
9. Add execution order/transaction on Stellar if profitability exceeds fee costs.
